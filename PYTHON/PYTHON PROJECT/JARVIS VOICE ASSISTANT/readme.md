# J.A.R.V.I.S - A personal assistant

## Created and Tested on windows with Python 3.9.0

An attempt to make a very simple, Personal Assistant that understands speech as well as text input and is capable of performing tasks other than conversing.

The basic idea behind this project is to create a simple stand-alone application
that helps less tech savvy people in the world to use the computer without feeling ignorant or computer illiterate.

The application works same like Siri/ Google Assistant etc. But the application deals with the computer itself mainly.

The U.I of the application is self-explanatory and minimal.
Currently it takes text as input as most of the people are not very good at speaking.

- ### Converses, barely.

    **Talk to J.A.R.V.I.S :** hello jarvis <br>

## Application:
jarvis is build to help the people with limited computer knowledge but it is also important to note that the other class of users might find some specific functionalities such as system logging useful.

The people who are not familiar getting around on their own on a computer can use this application as it abstracts away all the steps and presents only most important. Like they can just say to connect to a particular wifi or bluetooth, it will connect. Want to decrease screen brightness or volume? Want to open and close an application, file? Just say it as you would to a person, it will do the work for you.



It can also help with getting around web by opening, closing, bookmarking, reload, back, next etc a webpage just by saying it to do so.


Finally, it the solution for monitoring the computer. It is the solution for the parents who got a computer from their son/daughter and canâ€™t operate it to talk to them. It is the solution for the people who are willing to make a computer as their real assistant( not like fake so called assistants like Siri, Cortana etc ), just like Tony Stark?. Even if anyone uses it, you get complete stats about what he/she was doing, what did they connected etc.

## Contribution:

A lot can be done with this project.Core AI chatbot like functionality can be added. More python scripts can be associated. Pull requests for any such changes are accepted. Feel free to fork this project and make your own changes too.
